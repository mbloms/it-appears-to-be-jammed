# Final presentations
Today was the _final presentation_, although we were unfortunately not able to be completely done with the project before this session. However, we tried to be finished with the key parts (even if a little rough around the edges) so that we could get some feedback from the teachers and teacher assistants!

## Feedback
We are grateful for the feedback we received and the teachers highlighted some areas we had not really thought about that much. For example, they suggested that we put more emphasis on demonstrating the physical aspects of the simulation. During the presentation, the _traffic-light_ system we use in the intersections may have received a disproportionate amount of attention but by answering questions afterwards we hope that we got the purpose and idea of the model across. The intersections are mostly a tool for connecting the roads and the real purpose of the simulation is the traffic jams that occurs because the cars have to accelerate and decelerate alternately. Together with the reaction time of the driver (which is variable in our simulation) these _'hickups'_ in the traffic propagates and creates slow-moving traffic jams; just as they do in real life.

## Relative velocity in turns
In the last blog post we wrote some about the circular motion implemented to achieve actual turning when a car changes to another road. Unfortunately we didn't have time to fully fix the problems we experienced before the presentation, but now we have been able to work on them some more.

Now, instead of using a constant value for the speed in the turns, the cars retain the speed they had entering the turn as well as the ability to further accelerate as normal. This is a big improvement to the simulation; both visually since the cars behave more as one would expect them to, but also reducing the bottleneck-threat from the intersections by making the cars leave them faster.

### Demo
In the following video, the car decelerates before entering the intersection and then upon entering starts accelerating again before finally leaving the intersection and driving off to the next one.
