# Basic collision avoidance

## Acceleration and deceleration
Before this point, the cars were simply traveling at a fixed velocity right from the start. To make the first step in implementing collision avoidance the need for deceleration quite naturally arises. This first version of deceleration simply reduces the velocity every time the function is invoked. This function should then be called every _'frame'_ (i.e. the time-step made by Unity) if the car detects an impending collision with another object, be it another car or _'stop sign' / 'traffic light'_ at an intersection.

## First steps
The first kind of collision detection and avoidance we wanted to implement was that between the cars and the intersections themselves. The reason for not _"colliding"_ with the intersection is to not just go running straight into other cars if they are currently using the intersection. This is of course closely related to the traffic rules defined by the simplified traffic-lights we talked about in the previous post. Other than that, we also figured that most people would probably like to slow down a little before making a sharp right turn, for example. This way, a simple **behavioral model** is also starting to form for the drivers of the cars.

Thus, there are currently no collision detection between the cars themselves and they will, as seen in GIF below, end up driving inside one another. This is naturally not the way we want the simulation to be in the end, but we figured that the cars must first be able to stop at the intersections before other cars would have to stop and queue up behind them.
