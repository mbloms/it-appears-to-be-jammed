# Stopping at intersections

The first step of implementing the intersections using the lock-mechanism described in [the last post](2018-03-08.md) was to make the cars stop before each intersection, instead of simply driving right through it. We figured this would be a good action to take to improve the realism of the simulation, since most people would probably slow down a little and not drive headlong into the intersection at full speed.

The simulation looks pretty much like before, apart from the cars having some acceleration and decelration happening when they start driving and stop before the intersections. Right now the locks are not put in place so the cars simply wait for 100 (unity-) frames before jumping onto the next road. This only happens if the car is at the "top of the queue" for that specific interface in that intersection. Collision between the cars is not yet implemented as seen in the GIF<sup>1</sup> below; where the bright blue car parks inside the red car some time into the animation. Even though it looks like both cars are just at the intersection, they are actually ordered, so the blue car will wait until the red car has left before it counts up to 100 itself.

Collision detection between the cars will likely be implemented as the next step, or implementation of the locks. The two features are fairly independent of each other so it does not really matter. 

There has also been a lot of changes made _"under the hood"_ and we have refactored some old but key parts of the code to work better with our proposed changes and additions.
