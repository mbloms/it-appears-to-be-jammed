# Queues and collisions

Today we had some git related trouble as we tried to implement locks and queues at the same time. Although as we started over, doing these things in order, we eventually pulled through. 

Between two intersections there are two "lanes". These lanes are really two linked lists (or queues) containing the order of all the cars travelling between those two intersections in opposite directions. Firstly the ordered lists we're implemented without collision but there was still an order to the cars' intersection traversion. Thus the cars ended up ins I'd won an otter but left the intersection in their order of arrival.

Later a very basic form of collision detection was implemented to separate the queueing cars from one another by a reasonable distance. This is just a prototype and proper collision detection, along with acceleration and deceleration, will be implemented shortly.
