# Fully generated road network

The next step after designing functions for rendering roads and intersections, was to automatically generate the entire map. First we made a map on a simple paper and tried to make the map fairly complicated, but didn't really follow a particular strategy. In short, we didn't want the road net to be too trival nor always resulting in an enormous traffic jam.

The next step was to convert the map into actual digital coordinates. The coordinates for each intersection **(x,y)** was stored in a separate file as a _CSV_ list. The roads were represented as a tuple of two intersections, i.e. **(x1,xy,x2,xy)**. Since we already had functions to render an intersection and a road, the only thing left was to import the data into the Unity runtime and render accordingly.

This is a picture of the map that we drew; and its corresponding road net in Unity:

## The next steps

The next task we plan to do is to implement **one car** driving in the road network, with a very na√Øve driver; for example, choosing the next turn at random. To add more cars to the network, some kind of collision or traffic schedueling would have to be implemented. Though, that's perhaps even more distant.
