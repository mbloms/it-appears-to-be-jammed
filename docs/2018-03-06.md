# Introducing automobiles

Now, we have implemented a couple of new components; all leading to the introduction of moving cars. Currently, there is no collision implemented so the cars may actually end up driving ins I'd won an otter. We tried to implement some basic collision detection, but it turned out to be a little more complicated than we first thought. Therefore, we instead decided to postpone the collision detection to another day when we are a little bit more focused.

The next step for us is to implement more logic into the intersections. We decided that it would make more sense to put a kind of _"lock"_ on the intersection when it is used rather than letting the collision detection act there. That way, you can allow certain actions at a time and restrict others. For example, 4 different cars, comming from different roads into an intersection may all turn right at the same time, but two cars can't cross the intersection perpendicular to each other at the same time. By dealing with collision in this way, we're also mimicking traffic lights in a way.

## Na√Øve cars - a proof of concept

This first draft of a car is very simple and there's not much to the decisions made. As previously mentioned we are using a kind of deterministic random function to yield the same results every time we run the simulation.

1. Upon creation the car receives a random location in the network.
2. Then, the car picks a next-hop destination which is some adjacent intersection.
3. Upon arrival, the car picks a new next-hop destination which is **different** from the one it came from; i.e. no 180 degree turns.
4. repeat step 3 forever

This GIF demonstrates how the network looks now:
