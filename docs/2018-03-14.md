# Lifting intersection constraints
Now when we have a better implementation for the cars movement we can replace much of the intersection logic previously handled by the so called _'traffic light'_ system. One notable difference is that the intersection is not as "off limits" when someone else is driving as it was before (meaning that the cars drive a little more aggressively if you will). The collision detection mechanism in the intersection was in part replaced with a more simple one that just measures the euclidean distance between the cars. If this distance at any point becomes greater than the distance threshold held by the car in question; the car will start to brake in order to avoid a collision. Now the collision detection solution is near completed and as far as we know, all bugs has been rooted out. 

## Adding _"color"_ to the roads

We also made the roads appear more gray than before and added road markings to make it look more like a real road made of tarmac. This addition isn't that important to the simulation itself but makes the visualization a bit more pleasing to watch.
