# First draft of intersection logic

For some reason, parts of the code that weren't pushed to the GitHub repo mysteriously disappeared (spooky!). This unfortunately delayed us pretty much as we had to fix these issues and rewrite the missing code. After these issues were resolved we started working on the logic for the intersections. The sole purpose of the intersections is to connect the roads in the simulation so that cars can travel from one road onto another.

## Proposals

### Purely collision based 'wild west' solution
First we thought of a solution where the cars simply go into the intersection, turn to the direction they like and then simply drive there given that there is no imminent collision; in which case the car would have to brake and wait until there is room to drive. The main problem we saw with this model was that a complete grid-lock is quite probable, putting the traffic at a stand-still and drawing focus from the real traffic jams occurring on the roads.

### Simplified traffic-light solution
The second proposal, which we after some time actually decided to go with, is something that we would like to call a simplified version of a traffic-light or stop-sign system. In this solution, cars would not be allowed to drive simultaneously from two different lanes and in a direction that would cause a head-on collision. For example, if one car is driving coming into the intersection from the north and going to the south while at the same time, there is one traveling in the opposite direction; both cars would be allowed to drive. If however, the other car would make a left turn, i.e. directly crossing paths with the first car, the second car would not be allowed to drive. When creating this system we tried to mimic real world traffic lights as much as possible without putting too much focus on that specific part of the simulation.

The following image shows a visualization of how the traffic-light system acts. In this example, the lights are currently _"green"_ only for cars traveling from the west to the south (i.e. making a right turn) and cars traveling from the south to the west (making a left turn). All other cars would then have a "red light", although if there for example is a car waiting to the east wanting to drive west, they would be able to do so when the southern car is no longer blocking.

The cars are able to make the following kinds of turns in the intersections:
- make a turn directly to the right.
- drive right through the intersection.
- make a turn to the left, crossing the entire intersection.

We decided against implementing 180Â° turns since they aren't necessary for a functional road network and doesn't really add anything to the simulation as a whole.

#### Future improvements

One improvement that we want to make in the future is to use the regular collision detection more natively; i.e. allowing the cars to move _"freely"_ some more in the intersection as long as they drive properly (brake and accelerate etc).

## Next step
The next step for us is to start adding some collision avoidance to the cars. Initially, they will probably only have some basic collision avoidance, like not running head-long into an intersection, but this is only a first proof of concept.
