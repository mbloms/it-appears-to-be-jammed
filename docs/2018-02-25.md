# Roads and intersections
The initial model for the road network is a very simple one; road segments connected by intersections. The roads will naturally serve the purpose of making the simulation more lifelike, however, they are more importantly also used as contraints for the cars and drivers. In the end, the roads and cars will probably mostly be there for the _"visuals"_, but the datapoints used to create the road network can be used for navigation by the drivers too.

## Proof of concept
Initially, some basic roads and intersections were hardcoded. This was just to see that we have some working code and the road network will be dynamically generated in the future. Since we'll probably end up with a fairly complicated road network, making this abstraction will save us much time.

### Example
The following code ...

```csharp
intersection(0, 0);
intersection(0, 3);
intersection(2, 3);
road(0, 0, 0, 3);
road(0, 3, 2, 3);
```
... yields this _"road network"_:

In this image, the road segments are white and the intersections are red.  
The bottom left intersection is the one created by the first statement, with its center in (0, 0).
