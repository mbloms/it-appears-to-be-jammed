# First draft of intersection logic

For some reason, parts of the code that weren't pushed to the GitHub repo mysteriously disappeared (spooky!). This unfortunately delayed us some as we had to fix these issues and rewrite the missing code.

After the issues were resolved we started working on the logic for the intersections and how they schedule the cars driving into them.

Each intersections has one queue per interface (i.e. road leading into it). This queue is used to determine the order of approaching cars. To enable multiple cars to traverse the intersection simultaniously we engineered a _intersection lock systemâ„¢_ (patent not pending) to ensure that there are no collisions. To detect collision on the roads we'll use the queues for each intersection to determine the distances between all cars on the same road. However, to make the model a little less complex we decided to use this lock system instead of measuring distances etc while making a turn in the intersection.

In an intersection with 4 different interfacing roads, there are 3 ways for a car to drive:
- make a turn directly to the right; locking the bottom right quadrant in the example above.
- drive right through the intersection; locking the bottom right and top right quadrants.
- make a turn to the left; locking all three quadrants marked with red color in the example.
- (the 4th way of turning would be straight back to where you came from but we decided to disallow this dangerous and careless practice. We chose to implement the intersections like this because taking such a route really doesn't serve any purpose to our simulation.)

When a car is making a turn in the intersection it first locks the quadrants that it will use to make that turn. When a quadrant is locked, other cars can't make turns that would require the locked quadrant. So for example, only one car can make a left turn in an intersection at any given time, but up to 4 cars can make a direct turn right simultaniously since they all require different quadrants.
